Matlab Functions Library
====
Matlab functions for image processing in BEC1.


## Notes

* MATLAB 2014+
* Use everything in `/Final` without hesitation. `/In Progress`, not so much.
* Not yet packaged into a full toolbox
* For the python version, see [Therpy](https://github.com/ranchop/therpy)

## Usage

Most functions in `/Final` process a cell array of `images` into an `output` struct

```
[output] = Image_function(images)
```

To contribute, make a new function under `/In Progress`, test it, and when it's ready, move to `/Final`.
